                <span>This time, I‚Äôll introduce a playstyle focused on maximizing Chamie‚Äôs offensive capabilities.<br>
While Chamie is not commonly used in RTA, her skill set is highly versatile and holds great potential when utilized effectively. <br>
A particular highlight is her skill, "Rebirth" This skill removes all debuffs on herself, fully restores her HP, and increases both her attack power and defense by 50%.<br> 
Thanks to this powerful effect, Chamie can work as a durable tank in the early stages of battle while transitioning into a high-damage dealer in the latter stages, offering a flexible strategy.<br>
Chamie‚Äôs Skill 1 applies branding and healing block effects on the target, making it highly effective against monsters reliant on healing.<br> 
Furthermore, her Skill 2 not only steals enemy buffs but also applies irresistible debuffs, allowing her to leverage a wide variety of debuffs to turn the tide of battle in your favor.<br>
For this build, I focused on maximizing attack power while maintaining a certain level of durability.<br> 
Additionally, by utilizing artifacts to further enhance attack power and capitalize on bonus damage from skills, I designed Chamie to consistently deal approximately 4,000 damage per attack.<br> 
This setup enables her to inflict significant pressure on enemy monsters.<br>
In actual combat, there were many instances where Chamie became the primary target and faced concentrated attacks.<br> 
However, by properly utilizing "Rebirth," she could fully recover and execute counterattacks effectively.<br> 
Additionally, by employing branding and healing block effects, she was able to neutralize enemy recovery capabilities while dealing sustained damage.<br> 
This strategy is particularly effective against tank-type monsters, allowing her to maintain stable damage output even in prolonged battles.<br>
In conclusion, Chamie‚Äôs offense-focused build combines high attack performance with versatile debuff skills, enabling her to deal substantial damage to opponents.<br> 
However, proper adjustment of her durability is equally critical, as balancing offense and defense is the key to success.<br> 
By using this method of utilizing Chamie, you can expand your strategic options and achieve greater versatility in battles.</span>
