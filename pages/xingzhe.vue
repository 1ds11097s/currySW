                <span>The video introduces an RTA strategy that leverages "Speed 0" monsters.<br>
                This concept involves intentionally setting monsters, which would typically require speed, to zero speed to explore their potential. This time, Xing Zhe is featured.<br> 
                By utilizing his passive skill for automatic counterattacks and stun effects, the strategy explores how he can be effective in combat despite having zero speed.<br> 
                Previous examples of success with passive skill-focused monsters, such as Fuco (Wind Lich) and Amuduat (Dark Horus), serve as a foundation for this experiment.<br>
The specific stats for Xing Zhe are highly durable, with an additional 33,000 HP, 1,220 defense, 97 resistance, and 33 accuracy.<br> 
Counterattack runes are equipped to maximize the stun activation rate of Skill1.<br> 
This build is designed to fully capitalize on the skill enhancements made to Xing Zhe, which have led to an increase in his usage rate among high-level RTA players.<br>
In matches, Xing Zhe disrupts opponents‚Äô actions through stuns and counterattacks, creating advantageous situations.<br> 
His build compensates for the handicap of zero speed, even against immunity monsters and highly durable enemies.<br> 
The efficiency of the stun effect from counterattacks demonstrates the viability of a durability-centered strategy.<br> 
Notably, this approach proves stable even against high-damage water monsters or tanky enemies, highlighting its strength.<br>
In summary, while Speed 0 builds are not conventional strategies, this approach proves they can be viable under specific conditions.<br> 
Applying this tactic to passive skill monsters like Xing Zhe not only makes it more than just a gimmick but also broadens strategic possibilities.<br> 
It‚Äôs a meaningful effort to diversify RTA gameplay and serves as an inspiration for players seeking new challenges.<br>
Although such niche strategies may not appeal to everyone, they provide valuable insights for players focusing on durability and counterattack effects.<br></span>
