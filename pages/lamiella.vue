                <span>New characters, Specter Princess and Tomb Warden, have been introduced, and this time, I evaluated the performance of Specter Princess with her water attribute.<br> 
My focus was particularly on the mechanics of fixed damage and the Sacrifice system.<br>
Sacrifice accumulates every time an ally or enemy takes damage and deals damage based on a percentage of max HP depending on the accumulated amount.<br> 
However, the accumulation limit and speed are not clearly defined, making it necessary to analyze these aspects in actual usage.<br> 
It was confirmed that Sacrifice can accumulate quickly in situations where wide-range attacks are frequently used.<br>
Skill 3 stands out for its ability to apply provoke and branding up to three times, with a high activation rate.<br> 
This allows subsequent attackers to deal damage more effectively.<br> 
However, the skill‚Äôs relatively long cooldown and vulnerability to cooldown extension effects require attention.<br> 
To address these issues, I opted for a ‚ÄúViolent‚Äù rune build, enhancing durability while improving skill rotation efficiency.<br>
Additionally, She is believed to have excellent synergy with Belial.<br> 
Each time Belial is defeated, Sacrifice instantly reaches its maximum value, enabling consecutive skill activations.<br> 
Although we couldn‚Äôt test this combination during this evaluation, it is a point we aim to verify in future trials.<br>
In practical combat, I prioritized building defensive stats.<br> 
A rune configuration that increased HP ensured stable survivability while leveraging fixed damage.<br> 
This approach successfully eliminated key enemy characters efficiently.<br> 
By using provoke to restrict enemy actions and linking skills for high damage output, the strategy proved effective.<br> 
Since fixed damage is independent of critical hits, it offers high consistency and is particularly potent as it ignores the enemy‚Äôs defense and endurance.<br>
Countering control-type enemies and dealing with cooldown extension remain challenges, but apart from these, she demonstrates great versatility across various scenarios.<br> 
Moving forward, I aim to explore more practical strategies, including synergy with Belial.<br> 
This evaluation revealed a glimpse of her potential, and I plan to continue exploring her usage in diverse battle situations.</span>
