                <span>This video showcases gameplay using the new character Rex.<br>
                 Rex is a fire attribute character from the Tomb Warden series, and special attention is given to his skills 2 and 3.<br> 
                 In the video, Rex is developed and demonstrates his abilities in various battles.<br>
**Skill Characteristics and Strengths**: Rex's skill 3 performs a full-attack that has a 50% chance to apply a defense break while removing all beneficial effects from the enemy monsters.<br> 
This allows you to strip the enemy's buffs and apply defense break, increasing the damage dealt by subsequent attackers.<br> 
This effect is particularly powerful, and when paired with a strong attacker like Belial, it becomes even more effective.<br>
Skill 2 removes debuffs from all allies and grants the "Endure" effect, protecting allies for 2 turns.<br> 
This allows the team to withstand enemy attacks and also has the ability to revive fallen allies, making it an excellent support skill.<br>
**Stats and Runes**: Rex‚Äôs stats are focused on durability, with an emphasis on health.<br> 
Health is easy to stack, and in order to maximize the effectiveness of his skills, some accuracy is also necessary.<br> 
The runes used are Vio and Will, focusing on health to increase durability.<br> 
This setup enhances stability against attacks and helps handle defense-ignoring attacks.<br>
**Actual Use and Performance in Battles**: In actual battles, Rex demonstrates his strong support capabilities.<br> 
For example, even when the enemy has immunity or buffs active, his skill3 can strip them and lower the enemy‚Äôs defense.<br> 
This weakens the enemy‚Äôs durability, allowing subsequent attackers to deal more damage.<br> 
Additionally, his "Endure" effect from skill2 prevents allies from being knocked out and can revive fallen allies, giving a significant advantage in long battles.<br>
**Strengths and Limitations of Rex**: Rex is a very useful and powerful support character, but he is not so strong.<br> 
For example, he excels at situations where you want to apply defense break early or remove immunity.<br> 
However, he is not necessarily the optimal character for every situation, and his priority for development is not high.<br> 
If you already have other powerful characters, he may not be the first to prioritize.<br> 
Whether to develop him depends on whether you've finished developing other characters and if you have the resources to do so.</span>
