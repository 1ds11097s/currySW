                <span>This video showcases the use of the Water Attribute Hollyberry Cookie, Manon, in an ultra-high-damage-focused build for RTA
Manon was once a highly frequent pick in RTA, but its popularity significantly declined following a skill nerf.<br> 
Nevertheless, it remains a formidable asset in specific scenarios, making it essential to utilize it strategically.<br>
The build featured in this video adopts a Rage-type configuration, emphasizing critical damage and maximizing offensive potential.<br>
Manon‚Äôs greatest strength lies in its ability to deal massive damage to opponents lacking defense or immunity.<br> 
It is particularly effective against teams with many Fire Attribute monsters, allowing it to deliver unexpected and overwhelming damage when skills are used at the right moment.<br> 
The video also provides detailed explanations of stats and equipment setups, demonstrating how to balance HP, speed, critical rate, and critical damage to maximize its damage output.<br>
In the battles shown, the Rage-built Manon showcases astonishing damage potential in specific situations.<br> 
For example, against opponents with insufficient stripping of defense or immunity, its damage can disrupt enemy strategies.<br> 
On the other hand, misusing it can leave Manon vulnerable to counterattacks, underscoring the importance of careful situational judgment.<br> 
Compared to other builds like Violent or Despair, the Rage build is noted for its lack of stability.<br>
This build highlights the appeal of the Rage configuration, focusing on the thrill of one-hit-kill power that other setups cannot achieve.<br> 
It introduces unpredictable dynamics to matches, with the potential to shift the battle‚Äôs momentum entirely.<br>
The video presents several battle examples where Manon‚Äôs high damage proves decisive, including moments when its skills deliver unexpected results far beyond the opponent's anticipation.<br>
However, the Rage build‚Äôs low versatility and challenging mechanics make it less recommended for beginners.<br> 
For practicality, Violent or Despair builds are generally more stable choices.<br> 
That said, as a strategy tailored to specific scenarios in RTA, the Rage build remains a valid and unique option.<br> 
This video aims to fully convey the fun and appeal of the Rage build, encouraging viewers intrigued by its potential to give it a try.</span>
