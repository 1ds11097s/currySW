      <div id="1" class="headline font-weight-bold my-6" style="font-family: Anton!important;">Make turn2 work well, Introduction of methods</div>
      <v-row justify="center" class="main-banner-area rounded-xl subtitle-1 white--text pa-4 mb-4">
        <p>There are several important points to make turn2 work well<br><br>
About the monster<br>
There are several monsters that are important for turn2<br>
The essential monsters are leo, karnal, riley, belial, gapsoo<br>

Other important monsters are<br>
giou, minato, xing zhe, aaliyah, bolverk, feng yan, juno, mei hou wang, haegang, nana, woosa, veromos, lutia, mo long. josephine, abellio, verde<br>

The more important monsters you have, the easier it'll be for the turn2 team to work well<br><br>

About the runes<br>
Of course you need runes that are fast, but you don't have to use them for every monster.<br>
You need to use a lot of vio and desp runes, so farming with dragons and giants is necessary.<br>
To achieve higher ranks, you need to farm grind and gem with r5.<br><br>

About artifact<br>
Artifacts are important, but the quality of runes is more important.<br>
My artifact isn't that strong, but I'm still able to compete in the higher ranks.<br>
Each monster has its own options, but the priority is low.<br><br>

About speed<br>
The speed of the support monster needs to be fast.<br>
Other monsters' speed can be low, but their hp, def, res, etc. need to be high.<br>
For example, riley, aaliyah and other support monsters should be fast.<br>
Until around season 10, it was possible to win even if all monsters were slow, but in recent seasons, it's not possible to win.<br>
If the enemy team is the same turn2, it's possible to win, but if they are turn1 or CC team, speed is necessary.<br>
If you don't get your leo banned, it's not a problem, but basically turn1 and CC team players tend to ban more leo.<br>
So, to win in such a situation, you need a monster with high speed.</p>

      <div id="2" class="headline font-weight-bold my-6" style="font-family: Anton!important;">What's important in RTA</div>
      <v-row justify="center" class="main-banner-area rounded-xl subtitle-1 white--text pa-4 mb-4">
      Here are three important things to remember about rta<br><br>
First<br>
Strengthen your mentality<br>
rune and monster are important, but the most important thing is mentality<br>
Being able to pick and bang calmly will raise your rank<br>
It's not easy to strengthen your mentality, but my recommendation is streaming<br>
Streaming and talking with your audience is much less stressful than playing alone<br><br>

Second<br>
Analyze your losses<br>
Analyze what went wrong so that the next time you play against a similar opponent, you'll lose in a different way than the last time, and you'll be fine<br>
It's important to try different things to find out what the answer is<br>
There are many similar enemies, so if you don't analyze, you'll end up losing the same way<br><br>

Third<br>
Find players who have the same picks as you and add them to your favorites<br>
You can learn a lot from other players about their picks, bans and drafts that you might not have thought of on your own<br>
It would be nice to be able to ask that player questions if possible<br>
Even if you are making similar picks, a slight difference in the order of your picks can change the outcome<br>
Even if you use the monster from the second pick in the last pick, the enemy's picks will change, and you can reach a higher rank by learning such a strategy<br>

<span class="font-weight-bold">B-rank monsters</span><br>

As for akroma<br>
This monster became more versatile thanks to bp that added gauge increase, making it possible to interrupt the opponent.<br>
For example, when attacked with AoE or control skills, the gauge increase allows it to interrupt and stop the opponent’s moves, which is a significant strength.<br>
The situation where it would continuously take hits without response has been greatly improved, broadening its strategic potential.<br>
For these reasons, it’s rated as a strong B-rank monster this season.<br><br>

As for Elenoa<br>
This monster isn’t picked often, but its power is extremely strong when it does pick.<br>
In addition to skill 2’s cooldown reduction and skill 3’s ability to inflict multiple harmful effects on opponents, it can also equip Despair Runes to aim for AoE stuns, making it particularly effective against enemies without immunity.<br>
Even if the opponent is immune, she becomes very dangerous after the opponent removes it with other monsters<br><br>

As for Wind Monkey<br>
The frequency of this monster’s use has increased following its bp<br>
Previously, it had a skill that increased its gauge when attacked while unable to act, but now it has been buffed to include a stripping effect.<br>
Initially, I wasn’t sure how to interpret the change, but after using him, I found it more user-friendly than before.<br>
Its ability to strip immunity and follow up with a stun is particularly useful against trending immunity monsters.<br>
While it’s not an overwhelming meta pick, it’s balanced and strong enough as rank-b<br><br>

As for Chow<br>
This monster was once considered a disappointment but is now an essential pick.<br>
The main reason is its ability to remove two debuffs, such as stuns, defense breaks, silences, or bombs, allowing it to take action and shift the flow of battle.<br>
By pairing it with monsters like Giou or Velajuel to apply defense break, it can follow up to eliminate opponents like Belial.<br>
his stats can be adjusted to increase its damage output, making it highly versatile.<br>
Thus, it’s placed in the B-rank.<br><br>

<span class="font-weight-bold">A-rank monsters</span><br>

As for Bella<br>
This monster doesn’t pick frequently but stands out for its strength when it does.<br>
Though Bella lacks durability, making it susceptible to counters, allowing it free movement can be dangerous.<br>
In particular, combinations of additional damage and Violent Runes can result massive damage.<br>
no durability monsters can sometimes be taken out quickly, and Bella is often paired with other strong monsters, making it a difficult opponent to face.<br><br>

As for Mei Hou Wang<br>
A beloved pick for many players, this monster is versatile, effective in both turn1 and turn2<br>
It’s particularly effective against meta monsters like Sierra and Gianna<br>
its stun immunity alone is highly valuable, allowing it to perform consistently in early stages, while its potential to capitalize on defense breaks and Violent Rune procs makes it a late-game powerhouse.<br><br>

As for Jose<br>
This monster received so useful buff this season, with its provoke extending to two turns.<br>
The provoke limits the opponent’s actions, making it particularly troublesome to face.<br>
Its passive skill, which allows it to act when she stunned, has long been appreciated as a counter to Despair Runes or monsters like Gianna that aim to stun.<br>
Building its defense makes it effective against threats like Sonia<br><br>

As for Seimei<br>
With a passive skill that limits the duration of the opponent’s buffs to just one turn, she is incredibly powerful in the current RTA meta.<br>
It nullifies immunity and beneficial effects from monsters like Velajuel, Kovarch, and Shizuka<br>
Its ability to shorten the duration of debuffs also reduces the impact of effects like defense breaks,<br><br>

<span class="font-weight-bold">S-Rank Monsters</span><br>

As for Julian<br>
This monster received a nerf in BP this season, significantly reducing its stun rate compared to before.  Situations where it used to stuns almost without fail now have visibly lower success rates.<br>
Last season, Julian was rated as a Triple-S Rank monster, but due to this adjustment, it has been placed in the S-Rank tier. That said, its performance remains exceptionally high.<br>
Its ability to remove debuffs while dealing high damage is still intact, making it one of the more challenging monsters to take down. While it’s possible to defeat Julian with tesarion or Raki, it’s not a simple task, especially considering the support from surrounding monsters.<br>
Even as it stands, Julian is powerful enough that another nerf wouldn’t be surprising.<br><br>

As for Miles<br>
Although Miles pick rate has decreased compared to previous seasons, Its ability to deal consistent damage without relying on critical hits allows it to maintain high durability while continuously dishing out damage<br>
I recommend using one-shot monsters like Belial to counter it effectively.<br>
However, if that isn’t an option, it can be extremely difficult to take down, which is one of its most troublesome aspects<br>
it is possible in the future that he will be nerfed<br><br>

As for Zima<br>
This monster has newly entered the S-Rank tier this season.<br>
In previous seasons, Zima had a low pick rate and wasn’t ranked, but bp have completely changed its evaluation. The standout change is its ability to inflict a 2-turn silence effect on a selected target while performing an AoE attack, which is incredibly powerful.<br>
This skill allows her to greatly restrict the opponent’s actions right from the start, putting them in a state where they can’t use their skills.<br>
While her pick rate isn’t very high yet, it’s a troublesome presence when it does appear. Some top players have already started incorporating her into their strategies, so its pick rate may increase further in the upcoming seasons.<br><br>

<span class="font-weight-bold">SS-Rank monsters</span><br>

As for Water Twin Angel<br>
This monster continues to be a frequent pick this season<br>
She has highly versatile skills, including healing, shielding, AoE stuns, stripping buffs, and defense breaks. Although her AoE stuns and stripping + defense break are not guaranteed, I feel the percentage so high<br>  
For instance, if she manages to strip buffs and give defense break in her first move, it’s not uncommon for her high-damage teammates to follow up and deal massive damage.<br>
for example julian, ashourl<br>
While she disrupts the enemy team, her allies can freely act, making it very difficult to recover once she gains momentum.<br>
Water Twin Angel remains a top-tier monster, just as she was last season.<br><br>

As for Velajuel<br>
Velajuel is still one of the most popular first picks among many players this season.<br>
His skill2 short cooldown times are a key strength, as even if his cooldowns are extended, he can quickly use his skills again. Skill 2, in particular, has a 2-turn cooltime and can be used repeatedly when paired with Violent runes, allowing him to contribute both turn1 and turn2<br>
he supports his allies with healing and buffs while dealing damage with defense breaks, making him a versatile pick.<br>
Top players often include Velajuel in their teams, combining him with monsters like Chandra for highly effective strategies. His high pick rate and consistent performance make him an indispensable presence this season.<br><br>

As for Jeongnum<br>
this bp has made Jeongnu a highly notable monster.<br>
Nowadays, he’s frequently seen in specific team compositions, such as the Oliver + Jeongnum + Zima setup, which has proven to be extremely powerful.<br>
his strengths lie in his ability to heal all allies and his Skill 3, which provides AoE stuns and gauge increase. Additionally, Skill 2 deals fixed damage, ensuring reliable damage output against any target, making him an excellent choice for consistent chip damage.<br>
His fast skill rotation and ability to act before opponents add to his appeal.<br><br>

<span class="font-weight-bold">SSS-Rank Monsters</span><br>

As for Ragdoll<br>
he continues to be an incredibly strong monster.<br>
At g3, he is frequently picked. His passive is particularly troublesome, disrupting the opponent’s turn management through gauge increases.<br>
When attempting to execute a series of skill combos, Ragdoll can interrupt and turn the tide of the battle.<br>
he has consistently adapted to the meta, proving his worth as an SSS-Rank monster this season as well.<br><br>

As for Giana<br>
Although Giana’s stun rate was reduced from 100% to 85% this season, she remains a highly powerful monster.<br>
The slight nerf is noticeable at times, but her ability to control matches is still intact. Her skill set and versatility allow her to remain relevant in the meta, and maybe she will be nerfed even more<br><br>

As for Berghild<br>
Among Light monsters, Berghild is one of the strongest in the current meta.<br>
Her defining trait is her gauge-increaseing ability, which enables her to disrupt opponents by taking the first turn and chaining stuns and defense breaks.<br>
Plus she doesn't stun and therefore can't be stopped easily<br>
I see a lot of swift builds, but some players are using them in vio, so be careful<br>
Since she hasn’t received a nerf yet, there’s a possibility of it in the future.<br><br>

As for Kovarch<br>
she remains a formidable monster in the current meta.<br>
Her immunity-granting, attack buffing, and gauge-increasing capabilities make her an outstanding support.<br>
Skill 2, which shortens cooldowns and heals, is particularly powerful<br>
Compared to velajuel, she is more useful in some cases because she can continue to use immunity<br>
Stripping or defense-ignoring attacks are necessary to defeat her, but she remains difficult to counter effectively.<br><br>

Conclusion<br>
That wraps up the current RTA tier list. It will be interesting to see how this list changes with the BP adjustments in January.

This monster continues to be a frequent pick this season<br>
She has highly versatile skills, including healing, shielding, AoE stuns, stripping buffs, and defense breaks. Although her AoE stuns and stripping + defense break are not guaranteed, I feel the percentage so high<br>  
For instance, if she manages to strip buffs and give defense break in her first move, it’s not uncommon for her high-damage teammates to follow up and deal massive damage.<br>
for example julian, ashourl<br>
While she disrupts the enemy team, her allies can freely act, making it very difficult to recover once she gains momentum.<br>
Water Twin Angel remains a top-tier monster, just as she was last season.<br><br>

As for Velajuel<br>
Velajuel is still one of the most popular first picks among many players this season.<br>
His skill2 short cooldown times are a key strength, as even if his cooldowns are extended, he can quickly use his skills again. Skill 2, in particular, has a 2-turn cooltime and can be used repeatedly when paired with Violent runes, allowing him to contribute both turn1 and turn2<br>
he supports his allies with healing and buffs while dealing damage with defense breaks, making him a versatile pick.<br>
Top players often include Velajuel in their teams, combining him with monsters like Chandra for highly effective strategies. His high pick rate and consistent performance make him an indispensable presence this season.<br><br>

As for Jeongnum<br>
this bp has made Jeongnu a highly notable monster.<br>
Nowadays, he’s frequently seen in specific team compositions, such as the Oliver + Jeongnum + Zima setup, which has proven to be extremely powerful.<br>
his strengths lie in his ability to heal all allies and his Skill 3, which provides AoE stuns and gauge increase. Additionally, Skill 2 deals fixed damage, ensuring reliable damage output against any target, making him an excellent choice for consistent chip damage.<br>
His fast skill rotation and ability to act before opponents add to his appeal.<br><br>

<span class="font-weight-bold">SSS-Rank Monsters</span><br>

As for Ragdoll<br>
he continues to be an incredibly strong monster.<br>
At g3, he is frequently picked. His passive is particularly troublesome, disrupting the opponent’s turn management through gauge increases.<br>
When attempting to execute a series of skill combos, Ragdoll can interrupt and turn the tide of the battle.<br>
he has consistently adapted to the meta, proving his worth as an SSS-Rank monster this season as well.<br><br>

As for Giana<br>
Although Giana’s stun rate was reduced from 100% to 85% this season, she remains a highly powerful monster.<br>
The slight nerf is noticeable at times, but her ability to control matches is still intact. Her skill set and versatility allow her to remain relevant in the meta, and maybe she will be nerfed even more<br><br>

As for Berghild<br>
Among Light monsters, Berghild is one of the strongest in the current meta.<br>
Her defining trait is her gauge-increaseing ability, which enables her to disrupt opponents by taking the first turn and chaining stuns and defense breaks.<br>
Plus she doesn't stun and therefore can't be stopped easily<br>
I see a lot of swift builds, but some players are using them in vio, so be careful<br>
Since she hasn’t received a nerf yet, there’s a possibility of it in the future.<br><br>

As for Kovarch<br>
she remains a formidable monster in the current meta.<br>
Her immunity-granting, attack buffing, and gauge-increasing capabilities make her an outstanding support.<br>
Skill 2, which shortens cooldowns and heals, is particularly powerful<br>
Compared to velajuel, she is more useful in some cases because she can continue to use immunity<br>
Stripping or defense-ignoring attacks are necessary to defeat her, but she remains difficult to counter effectively.<br><br>

Conclusion<br>
That wraps up the current RTA tier list. It will be interesting to see how this list changes with the BP adjustments in January.
