        <p>There are several important points to make turn2 work well<br><br>
About the monster<br>
There are several monsters that are important for turn2<br>
The essential monsters are leo, karnal, riley, belial, gapsoo<br>

Other important monsters are<br>
giou, minato, xing zhe, aaliyah, bolverk, feng yan, juno, mei hou wang, haegang, nana, woosa, veromos, lutia, mo long. josephine, abellio, verde<br>

The more important monsters you have, the easier it'll be for the turn2 team to work well<br><br>

About the runes<br>
Of course you need runes that are fast, but you don't have to use them for every monster.<br>
You need to use a lot of vio and desp runes, so farming with dragons and giants is necessary.<br>
To achieve higher ranks, you need to farm grind and gem with r5.<br><br>

About artifact<br>
Artifacts are important, but the quality of runes is more important.<br>
My artifact isn't that strong, but I'm still able to compete in the higher ranks.<br>
Each monster has its own options, but the priority is low.<br><br>

About speed<br>
The speed of the support monster needs to be fast.<br>
Other monsters' speed can be low, but their hp, def, res, etc. need to be high.<br>
For example, riley, aaliyah and other support monsters should be fast.<br>
Until around season 10, it was possible to win even if all monsters were slow, but in recent seasons, it's not possible to win.<br>
If the enemy team is the same turn2, it's possible to win, but if they are turn1 or CC team, speed is necessary.<br>
If you don't get your leo banned, it's not a problem, but basically turn1 and CC team players tend to ban more leo.<br>
So, to win in such a situation, you need a monster with high speed.</p>
